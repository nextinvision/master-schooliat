2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
System Classification:
The SchooliAt School ERP is a standalone, multi-tenant software platform designed specifically for K-12 educational institutions. It is a new system developed from the ground up, not a modification of an existing product.
System Architecture:
•	Multi-tenant Architecture: The System supports multiple schools under a centralized Super Admin, with each school operating independently with its own admin, faculty, staff, and students while sharing the same underlying infrastructure.
•	Three-tier Architecture: Presentation layer (web and mobile clients), application layer (RESTful API backend), and data layer (PostgreSQL database).
•	Unified API Layer: Both web and mobile front-ends consume the same centralized API layer, ensuring consistency in business logic and data access across platforms.
•	Role-based UI Adaptation: The same API serves different UI experiences tailored to each user role's specific needs and workflows.
System Context:
The System operates as an integrated platform that replaces or consolidates multiple disparate systems typically used in schools, such as separate attendance systems, fee management software, communication tools, and academic record systems. It provides a single source of truth for all school-related data and operations.
External Interfaces:
•	Email System: Interfaces with SMTP servers for sending notifications, OTPs, and communications
•	Cloud Infrastructure: Deployed on AWS, GCP, or Azure platforms for hosting, storage, and compute resources
•	SMS/WhatsApp (Optional): Potential integration for phone-based OTP delivery if configured
